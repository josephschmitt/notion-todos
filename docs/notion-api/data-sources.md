All [data source objects](/reference/data-source) include a child `properties` object. This `properties` object is composed of individual data source property objects. These property objects define the data source schema and are rendered in the Notion UI as data columns.

> ## 📘
> 
> Data source rows
> 
> If you’re looking for information about how to use the API to work with data source rows, then refer to the [page property values](/reference/property-value-object) documentation. The API treats data source rows as pages.

Every data source property object contains the following keys:

| Field | Type | Description | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | An identifier for the property, usually a short string of random letters and symbols.  
  
Some automatically generated property types have special human-readable IDs. For example, all Title properties have an `id` of `"title"`. | `"fy:{"` |
| `name` | `string` | The name of the property as it appears in Notion. |  |
| `description` | `string` | The description of a property as it appear in Notion. |  |
| `type` | `string` (enum) | The type that controls the behavior of the property. Possible values are:  
  
\- `"checkbox"`  
\- `"created_by"`  
\- `"created_time"`  
\- `"date"`  
\- `"email"`  
\- `"files"`  
\- `"formula"`  
\- `"last_edited_by"`  
\- `"last_edited_time"`  
\- `"multi_select"`  
\- `"number"`  
\- `"people"`  
\- `"phone_number"`  
\- `"place"`  
\- `"relation"`  
\- `"rich_text"`  
\- `"rollup"`  
\- `"select"`  
\- `"status"`  
\- `"title"`  
\- `"url"` | `"rich_text"` |

Each data source property object also contains a type object. The key of the object is the `type` of the object, and the value is an object containing type-specific configuration. The following sections detail these type-specific objects along with example property objects for each type.

> 
> Database relations must be shared with your integration
> 
> To retrieve properties from data source [relations](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups#what-is-a-database-relation), the related database must be shared with your integration in addition to the database being retrieved.

## 

Title

[](#title)

A title data source property controls the title that appears at the top of a page when a data source row is opened. The `title` type object itself is empty; there is no additional configuration.

Example title data source property object

`"Project name": {   "id": "title",   "name": "Project name",   "type": "title",   "title": {} }`

> ## 🚧
> 
> All data sources require one, and only one, `title` property.
> 
> The API throws errors if you send a request to [Create a data source](/reference/create-a-data-source) or [Create a database](/reference/database-create) without a `title` property, or if you attempt to [Update a data source](/reference/update-a-data-source) to add or remove a `title` property.

> ## 📘
> 
> Title data source property vs. data source title
> 
> A `title` data source property is a type of column in a data source.
> 
> A data source `title` defines the title of the data source and is found on the [data source object](/reference/data-source).
> 
> Every data source requires both a data source `title` and a `title` data source property. This ensures that we have both:
> 
> -   An overall title to display when viewing the database or data source in the Notion app
> -   A title property for each page under the data source, so page titles can be displayed in the Notion app

## 

URL

[](#url)

A URL data source property is represented in the Notion UI as a column that contains URL values.

The `url` type object is empty. There is no additional property configuration.

Example URL data source property object

`"Project URL": {   "id": "BZKU",   "name": "Project URL",   "type": "url",   "url": {} }`

## 

Unique ID

[](#unique-id)

A unique ID data source property records values that are automatically incremented, and enforced to be unique across all pages in a data source. This can be useful for task or bug report IDs (e.g. TASK-1234), or other similar types of identifiers that must be unique.

The `unique_id` type object can contain an optional `prefix` attribute, which is a common prefix assigned to pages in the data source. When a `prefix` is set, a special URL (for example, `notion.so/TASK-1234`) is generated to be able to look up a page easily by the ID. Learn more in our [help center documentation](https://www.notion.com/help/unique-id) or [Notion Academy lesson](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-academy/lesson/unique-id-property).
