# Data source properties

Data source property objects are rendered in the Notion UI as data columns.

All [data source objects](https://developers.notion.com/notionapi/reference/data-source) include a child `properties` object. This `properties` object is composed of individual data source property objects. These property objects define the data source schema and are rendered in the Notion UI as data columns.

> 📘 Data source rows
>
> If you’re looking for information about how to use the API to work with data source rows, then refer to the [page property values](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-value-object) documentation. The API treats data source rows as pages.

Every data source property object contains the following keys:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Field",
    "h-1": "Type",
    "h-2": "Description",
    "h-3": "Example value",
    "0-0": "`id`",
    "0-1": "`string`",
    "0-2": "An identifier for the property, usually a short string of random letters and symbols.  \n  \nSome automatically generated property types have special human-readable IDs. For example, all Title properties have an `id` of `\"title\"`.",
    "0-3": "`\"fy:{\"`",
    "1-0": "`name`",
    "1-1": "`string`",
    "1-2": "The name of the property as it appears in Notion.",
    "1-3": "",
    "2-0": "`description`",
    "2-1": "`string`",
    "2-2": "The description of a property as it appear in Notion. ",
    "2-3": "",
    "3-0": "`type`",
    "3-1": "`string` (enum)",
    "3-2": "The type that controls the behavior of the property. Possible values are:  \n  \n- `\"checkbox\"`\n- `\"created_by\"`\n- `\"created_time\"`\n- `\"date\"`\n- `\"email\"`\n- `\"files\"`\n- `\"formula\"`\n- `\"last_edited_by\"`\n- `\"last_edited_time\"`\n- `\"multi_select\"`\n- `\"number\"`\n- `\"people\"`\n- `\"phone_number\"`\n- `\"place\"`\n- `\"relation\"`\n- `\"rich_text\"`\n- `\"rollup\"`\n- `\"select\"`\n- `\"status\"`\n- `\"title\"`\n- `\"url\"`",
    "3-3": "`\"rich_text\"`"
  },
  "cols": 4,
  "rows": 4,
  "align": [
    "left",
    "left",
    "left",
    "left"
  ]
}
[/block]

Each data source property object also contains a type object. The key of the object is the `type` of the object, and the value is an object containing type-specific configuration. The following sections detail these type-specific objects along with example property objects for each type.

## Checkbox

A checkbox data source property is rendered in the Notion UI as a column that contains checkboxes. The `checkbox` type object is empty; there is no additional property configuration.

> 📘 Database relations must be shared with your integration
>
> To retrieve properties from data source [relations](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups#what-is-a-database-relation), the related database must be shared with your integration in addition to the database being retrieved. If the related database is not shared, properties based on relations will not be included in the API response.
>
> Similarly, to update a data source relation property via the API, share the related database with the integration.

A group is a collection of options. The `groups` array is a sorted list of the available groups for the property. Each group object in the array has the following fields:

> 🚧 It is not possible to update a status data source property's `name` or `options` values via the API.
>
> Update these values from the Notion UI, instead.

## Title

A title data source property controls the title that appears at the top of a page when a data source row is opened. The `title` type object itself is empty; there is no additional configuration.

```json Example title data source property object
"Project name": {
  "id": "title",
  "name": "Project name",
  "type": "title",
  "title": {}
}
```

> 🚧 All data sources require one, and only one, `title` property.
>
> The API throws errors if you send a request to [Create a data source](https://developers.notion.com/notionapi/reference/create-a-data-source) or [Create a database](https://developers.notion.com/notionapi/reference/database-create) without a `title` property, or if you attempt to [Update a data source](https://developers.notion.com/notionapi/reference/update-a-data-source) to add or remove a `title` property.

> 📘 Title data source property vs. data source title
>
> A `title` data source property is a type of column in a data source.
>
> A data source `title` defines the title of the data source and is found on the [data source object](https://developers.notion.com/notionapi/reference/data-source).
>
> Every data source requires both a data source `title` and a `title` data source property. This ensures that we have both:
>
> * An overall title to display when viewing the database or data source in the Notion app
> * A title property for each page under the data source, so page titles can be displayed in the Notion app

## URL

A URL data source property is represented in the Notion UI as a column that contains URL values.

The `url` type object is empty. There is no additional property configuration.

```json Example URL data source property object
"Project URL": {
  "id": "BZKU",
  "name": "Project URL",
  "type": "url",
  "url": {}
}
```

## Unique ID

A unique ID data source property records values that are automatically incremented, and enforced to be unique across all pages in a data source. This can be useful for task or bug report IDs (e.g. TASK-1234), or other similar types of identifiers that must be unique.

The `unique_id` type object can contain an optional `prefix` attribute, which is a common prefix assigned to pages in the data source. When a `prefix` is set, a special URL (for example, `notion.so/TASK-1234`) is generated to be able to look up a page easily by the ID. Learn more in our [help center documentation](https://www.notion.com/help/unique-id) or [Notion Academy lesson](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-academy/lesson/unique-id-property).

```json Example unique ID data source property object
"Task ID": {
  "prefix": "TASK"
}
```
